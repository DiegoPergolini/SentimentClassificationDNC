# Sentiment Classification with Differentiable Neural Computers
The scope of this work is to perform a complex task like sentiment classification with one of the newest type of recurrente neural network, like the DNC's.

In order to do this, i have used the TensorFlow' s [implementation](https://github.com/deepmind/dnc) provided by Google DeepMind 
and the [Amazon Datasets](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/) provided by the University of Stanford. 
To achieve the best results i used a [pre-trained word2vec model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit) to encode the reviews and pass them to the network.
